# Disc Golf League Tournament Rating System - Project Context

## Current State of the Project

We've developed a tournament-style rating system for a doubles disc golf league with the following components:

### 1. Core System

**Tournament-Style Rating System** (`tournament_ratings.py`, `tournament_manager.py`)
   - Designed for format where all teams compete simultaneously
   - Teams ranked by total throws (lowest score wins)
   - Position-based rating adjustments
   - Ghost player support for odd numbers of players
   - Optional SQLite database support (`tournament_ratings_db.py`, `tournament_manager_db.py`, `tournament_db_manager.py`)

### 2. Key Features Implemented

- Individual player ratings
- Team rating calculations
- Tournament outcome predictions
- Rating adjustments based on expected vs. actual outcomes
- Balanced team generation
- Detailed player history tracking
- Tournament history recording
- Ghost player support for odd numbers of players
- Optional SQLite database storage

### 3. Command-Line Interfaces

- `tournament_manager.py` - For tournament-style system with JSON storage
- `tournament_manager_db.py` - For tournament-style system with optional database support

### 4. Example Scripts

- `example_tournament.sh` - Demonstrates the tournament-style system
- `example_ghost_player.sh` - Demonstrates the ghost player feature
- `example_db_storage.sh` - Demonstrates the database storage feature

## Next Steps

### 1. Web Interface Development

- Create a simple web interface for easier management
- Implement Flask/Django backend to expose API endpoints
- Develop frontend for player management, tournament recording, and statistics

### 2. Enhanced Analytics

- Add statistical analysis of player performance
- Implement trend visualization for player ratings
- Calculate player improvement rates and projections

### 3. Course-Specific Adjustments

- Add course difficulty ratings
- Implement course-specific performance tracking
- Adjust expected scores based on course difficulty

### 4. Mobile App Integration

- Design a mobile-friendly interface
- Create API endpoints for mobile app consumption
- Implement real-time score entry during tournaments

### 5. Advanced Features

- **Handicap System**: Implement a handicap system for more balanced competition
- **Team Consistency Tracking**: Analyze how consistently teams perform
- **Player Compatibility Scores**: Determine which players perform best together
- **Tournament Scheduling**: Add functionality to schedule and manage tournaments
- **Weather Impact Analysis**: Track how weather conditions affect scores

### 6. Documentation and Testing

- Create comprehensive user documentation
- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for system components

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages and exception handling
   - Add input validation for all user inputs

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize data handling for larger datasets
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add user authentication for multi-user environments
   - Implement proper input sanitization

## How to Continue Development

1. Select a next step from the list above
2. Begin implementation with the existing codebase as a foundation

The most recent work was adding ghost player support for odd numbers of players, which is now fully implemented.
